  <p align="center">App to rank superheroes by their humility.</p>

## Description

Monorepo that has both the `api` and the `web-client` of the **Humble Superhero App**.

The **Humble Superhero App** allows the users to create Superheroes adding a name, a superpower and a humility score for each of them. Then, all the created superheroes can be listed to find out which is the most or least humble.

## Team

I have been the only developer of the application. Generally, on software projects, collaborative environments are needed to create a really impactful code. However, collaboration can be tough, specially when there are no systems or strategies that make all team members push together towards the same direction.

If I would have to collaborate with at least one developer, I would split the application in different features (e.g. the get endpoint or a new endpoint to delete). Each feature would become a task or a set of tasks. Then, I would throw the tasks into a Kanban board using tools like Jira or Azure DevOps. Finally, each one of us would start developing a task at a time. The assignation of each task would be done dynamicaly, based on the needed skills and its priority.

An other agile methodology that, in my opinion, could be a plus in bigger teams or in large development roadmaps, is Scrum. What I feel is the most interesting part of that methodology are the retrospectives done after each sprint.

Finally, we would also need to set a git workflow. Being a two-members team working with Kanban, a simple way to handle git branches would be by using a branch for each feature (Git Feature Branch Workflow). When a feature is finished, the branch is merged to master.

## If I had more time

As the title says, "If I had more time..." I would expand the list features creating a whole CRUD for superheroes. Instead of just adding, I would also implement the update and the delete features.
